# Vision

A thought is alive. 


# Mission

To help the most welcome thoughts achieve reality so positive achievement-related experiences happen to people.  


# TBD: Core values

1. **Active listening** to the thoughts (meditation, mindfulness, vipassana, psychology, etc.)
2. **Effective decision making** (Viveka (aka. "right understanding," "discrimination"), Ahimsa (aka. "nonviolence"), self-realization (incl. via thoughts), MVI - Minimum Valuable Increment, etc.)
3. **Welcomeness** (Opensource, Transparency, Creativity, Honesty, Human-friendly)
4. **Technology-empowered** (Emerging Technology Top 10 List by CompTIA, - while the better approach to track what's comming is not detected, etc.)
5. **Data-driven** (e.g. proof-backed, research hungry, etc.)
6. **Connectable-systems-thinking** (e.g. Fengshui maps, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, - while the better approach to prioritize the base of values is not detected, etc.)


# Strategy

1. Constantly collect thoughts-ideas, e.g. https://github.com/PauliusMacernis/ideas/
2. Constantly and efficiently prioritize the list in order to enlight the most welcome thoughts-ideas
3. Constantly track the minimum amount of projects required to address at once in order to succeed with at least one from the list. Treat a project as a startup. Currently we need to entackle 10-11 projects so at least 1 becomes successfull, because 90% of startups fail https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp
4. Constantly address the well known failure factors, avoid these in the active projects. E.g. https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics/
5. Constantly construct Minimum Valuable Increment (MVIs - https://www.codurance.com/publications/2020/01/27/minimum-valuable-increment) for the active projects. 1 MVI per project is enough, more is considered a bad practice - premature optimization, waterfall, etc.
6. Work on each MVI with no interuptions. The more welcome the thought is, the more MVIs may be addressed, e.g. TOP1st - 10 MVIs one by one, TOP2nd - 9 MVISs one by one, etc.
7. Share the profit
8. Open for others to join at any of steps
